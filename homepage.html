        <h2>Welcome to Maison de la Lune</h2>
        <p>This house is truly unique, being part of a historic 500-year-old home which was once inhabited by a notable Hajjaj. The house exudes tranquillity, with a layout that reflects peaceful living.
        It is ideal for a large family or visitors of any size to Tetouan. Located within the old Medina, it is just a few minutes' walk to the palace, markets, craft stalls, car park, and main high streets.
        The evenings here are adorned with stars, jasmine, and a serene atmosphere. 
        </p>
